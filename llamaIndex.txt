AI agents can be built with smolagent, llamaindex and langraph....

smolagent use code-like to execute task 

LlamaIndex 
LlamaIndex has three key parts 
1. components
2. Tools
3. Agents 

Components - they are the basic building blocks used in LlamaIndex... They include prompts,models and databases and the components can also help you connect with other tools and libraries 

Tools-they provide specific capabailities... they are the hands of the Llm 

Agents- Agents use the tols to make decisions... they allow to perform the task

workflows - are the step-by-step process that process logic altogether


How to Install LlamaIndex

pip install llama-index-[component-type]-[framework-name]

RAG(Retrieval Augemented Generation)- allows you to find relevant information from data
The QueryEngine allows the agent to what is above

5 stages in a RAG
1. loading- fetching the data from where it lives... maybe a website,pdf,file,another,website,database or api into the your workflows

2. Indexing- a data structure that allows to query the data.. for LLMs they use vector embeddings which is a numerical representation of the data 

3. Storing -
